## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

### About me

Theoretical Physicist, close (~ October 2021) to finish my PhD in Particle Physics, I am actively looking for job opportunities in Data Science / Engineering. 

I am strongly interested in Statistical Software Development, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I spend most of my coding time in R and C++, but I also enjoy delving into Python.
